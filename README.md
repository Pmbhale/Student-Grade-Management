A console-based Java application to manage student records and calculate grades based on marks entered.
This project is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles with Java classes and objects to provide a simple yet effective grade management solution.

The system allows users to enter student details, input marks for multiple subjects, compute average scores, and assign grades (A/B/C/Fail).
It features a menu-driven interface for smooth interaction.
